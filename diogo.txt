Este é um rápido overview nas civs disponíveis no Age of Empires IV.
English: The easiest civ to learn and play, English is a bit weak, but still pretty flexible with a variety of strategies. Traiditonally, it's considered good in feudal and imperial, but weak in castle. English, with its longbows and Council Hall, is still very good at putting on feudal aggro, and so a lot of people start learning English through a feudal longbow push. Recently, especially at the pro level, English players have started going for a fast castle build as well, into mainly knights supported by longbows and men at arms. English likely has the best Imperial late-game in the game, thanks to its infinite gold farms and the cheap trebs produced by the Wynguard Palace. When you play English, you are often looking to put pressure on in feudal (or early castle if you do the fast castle build) to damage your opponent, either winning the game outright or crippling them so that you can reach your superior Imperial.

French: The other easy civ to learn and play, French has been a very traditionally strong civ, especially at the lower ends of the ladder. French Royal Knights remain one of the strongest units in the game, and French economic bonuses are both easy to use and strong. Right now, French's most typical strategy is heavy feudal play; they take a second tc while building knights to harras their opponent, then put on heavy pressure with knights supported by archers (and spears as necessary). If they can't finish the job in feudal, they'll often go castle with Royal Instititue to gain access to Royal Bloodlines and other super-powerful upgrades to deal the finishing blow. French Imperial is generally considered mediocre, though fully upgraded Elite Royal Knights and Elite Arbs are still a force to be reckoned with.

HRE: This civ's most typical build is a fast castle with the Aachen Chapel. It can get the fastest castle of all civs thanks to the income boost that prelate inspiration provides. The default landmakr for fast castle is the Regnitz, which acts as a monastery and doubles the income of all garrisoned relics (you can garrison them elsewhere). The Burgrave Palace is a more niche option; it's usually used either when you're under heavy feudal pressure (from say French or English) and need units to defend, or if you feel like you can kill your opponent with a MAA castle timing push (most often, in my opinion, vs China). Assuming you went Regnitz, the default as HRE is to then go for a fast Imperial with the Palace of Swabia, and then max out with a massive economy and really strong infantry. Most HRE players will build some knights in castle to secure relics and take map control, and then transition to MAA, Landsneks, and Horsemen in Imperial.

China: My personal favorite civ, China is a very flexible and responsive civ. Typically, the civ will go for a boom with 2TC Song Dynasty in Feudal, which provides the villager production of 3TC. It then can choose to play heavily in castle with Palace Guards, Xbows, Lancers, and Nest of Bees, or go into a relatively quick Imperial for access to Handcannons, Spirit Way Zhuge Nu, and later on Fire Lancers. China can also forgo the second town center for just 1TC Song in Feudal, if they feel they going to come under heavy feudal pressure. China used to have one of the strongest lategames with grenadiers and bombards, but that got nerfed. It's Imperial is still strong, but nowadays revolves around running Fire Lancers killing villagers everywhere while a core of Handcannons with supporting siege and infantry push

Abbasid: Abbasid has recently risen to be one of the best civs in the current meta, and it's very robust and resilient. The default Abbasid build is to go 2TC with Fresh foodstuffs in Feudal (sometimes 3TC depending on the opp civ and build). Then Abbasid often goes Horseman/Camel Archer in Feudal to apply pressure and control the map, adding on Lancers in Castle. Abbasid in castle can also go for a more infantry/siege based playstyle, often using a forward keep drop to set up a siege of the enemy base. Abbasid has a very strong Imperial, with Culverins for siege advantage and super strong trash units (those that don't cost gold) in the form of its phalanx spearmen and imperial camel archers

Delhi: Delhi used to be one of the strongest civs, but has fallen off recently, though it's still plenty playable. It's strong in Feudal and Castle, but probably has the worst Imperial of any civ. Typicla Delhi play revolves around Horsemen/Archer aggression in Feudal to take the sacred sites, and then using the sacred site gold to go fast castle, get the relics, and add on MAA, Lancers, and Elephants as needed. Delhi will also often build lots of scholars for the healing in Feudal and Castle. Delhi can also do a forward Keep drop pretty well if they go for Compound of the Defender in Castle. But Delhi cannot go Imperial. If you go Imp as Delhi, you probably lost (or already won and the opponent just hasn't surrendered yet). Recently, because normal Delhi has fallen off somewhat, the pros and other players have been experimenting with 2TC Delhi with the Tower of Victory, but I'm personally not convinced.

Rus: Rus is one of the strongest civs in the current meta, and very flexible. Rus plays well in Feudal, Castle, and Imperial. Typical Rus play involves taking the boar in early Feudal, and then you can decide to go for a 1TC push, or 2TC boom (into Feudal Push or Fast Castle). In Castle, Rus can add in horse archers along with getting their unique Knight/Cav upgrades, and in Imperial, Rus Streltzy/Springald is still one of the strongest compositions in the game

Mongol: Mongol is possibly the civ whose meta is the most in flux right now. People are still trying to figure out the best way to play Mongols. The old Mongol build involved a dark age Tower Rush into Fast Castle. This build still exists, along with towerless dark age aggro with horsemen, but Mongols have definitely beeen experiementing. I've seen Feudal 2TC, or just a blind fast castle, or Feudal Aggro. Once Mongol hits castle it usually tries to take the Relics, harass with Lancers and adding in supporting units, and put outposts all around the map for map control/vision and the Yam network speed boost. Mongol is decent in Imperial because it has decent units in Imp, but their lack of walls really hurts there.

Este Quarta-feira vai haver um torneio 1v1 Kings and Castles! Organizado por: Joe e StephenLoky e criaram esse campeonato com o intuito de fomentar o cenário de Age of Empires IV e unir a comunidade do game.
Os jogadores serão separados em 3 ligas por elo baseado na temporada (season) 3: Até o Platina 2 (>1100), Platina 2 ao Diamante 3 (1100 > 1350) e Diamante 3+ (1350+).
São apenas 8 jogadores por liga em uma disputa de dupla-eliminação. Quem vence avança na chave e quem perde desce para a chave perdedora. Na segunda derrota, ele é eliminado.

O Calheta é um noob desgraçado.

Apenas a final de cada liga é disputada em uma melhor de 3 (BO3).
